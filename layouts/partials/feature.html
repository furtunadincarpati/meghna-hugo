					     </br></br><b>My background:</b>	
					     </br>I am one of those increasingly rare people who enjoy their 9 to 5. I work as a Business Analyst for an internatonal corporation. Over the years,
					     after going through tough times working in various companies and eventually falling flat on my face, nearly experiencing a burnout, I saw the light.
					     <b><u>It was me.</u></b> I was the one setting myself up for burnout and failure, creating and maintaining a negative perception of my colleagues and of the work environment.
					     Slowly, very slowly, I began changing the way I see work, my colleagues, and the entire company culture. And I am happy to tell you that it lead to a major shift and transformation.
					     I am no longer giving my power away thinking that there is something outside of me responsibile for my fulfillment and well-being. As a result, I am a happy and motivated employee
					     who implements creatively, asks for what is important, and works in a sustainable way. And you can be the same.  
				             </br>Does that sound desirable? If so, I invite you on a discovery journey sprinkled with breakthroughs and satisfaction, eventually rewarded by a safe and comfortable state of being.					</p>
