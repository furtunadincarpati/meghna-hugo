					     </br>I am also one of those increasingly rare people who enjoy their 9 to 5. After going through tough times working in various companies
					     and eventually falling flat on my face, nearly experiencing a burnout, I saw the light.
					     </br></br><b><u>It was me!</u></b> 
		 			     </br></br>I was the one setting myself up for burnout and failure, creating and maintaining a negative perception of my colleagues and of the work environment.
					     Slowly, very slowly, I began changing the way I see work, my colleagues, and the entire company culture. And I am happy to tell you that it lead to a major shift and transformation.
					     I am no longer giving my power away believing that something outside of me is responsibile for my work satisfaction and well-being. As a result, I am happy and motivated by my work,
					     creative and confident around all my colleagues, and most importantly, my effort is sustainable.   
				             </br>Does that sound desirable? If so, I invite you on a discovery journey sprinkled with breakthroughs and satisfaction, eventually rewarded by a progressive and stable situation. In a nutshell...					</p>
					  
						<h4>I help you <u>avoid burnout</u>, 
						<br>achieve a <b style="color:#21a008">sustainable flow</b>,
						<br>and become your own <b style="color:#FF9F1C">best friend</b>.</h4>
