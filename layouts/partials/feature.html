					     </br><p> Welcome! I am Vlad, a trained coach and human with a big <span aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-heart fa-anim-vertical-shake" style="color:#FF0064"></span>
					     
					     </br>After exploring the job market, traveling through Europe, and chasing ideas of success and happiness during my 20s, I ended up living in Austria
					     and working as a Business Analyst. And I felt happy. For a while. Then I begun chasing more and more efficiency in life, in my self-development,
					     and in my job. Gradually, I started feeling burned out by the race, by the constant struggle to control and arrange my environment 
					     in order to get what I thought I needed for happiness. Fortunately, the discovery and practice of mindfulness helped me change my point of view, 
					     and slowly, my values transformed. When 2020 arrived I decided to put the newfound values into action, which led me to train as a coach.
					     It was one of my best decisions so far. 
				
					     </br></br>I see life as an exciting journey towards mastery, with change being a key part of it. Yet <u>change has not always been easy for me</u>.
					     It required my awareness, time, commitment, compassion, and ability to let go. And that's on a good day! In extreme cases, the need to change can arrive as a shock, 
					     in the form of life altering events such as separation, loss of employment, poor health, etc. Since forced change can be very disruptive,
		                             I developed my personality and life around the ability to create smooth transitions. When I became a coach I quickly noticed the value of such an approach: 
					     if progress in life involves change, then coaching is a tool to transform costly disruptions into <b>smooth transitions</b>. 
					     <!-- </br>Speaking of smooth sailing, how is your connection to your hopes, dreams, and aspirations?
					     </br></br>My journey so far has helped refine an aptitude for communication, patterns, and people through various 
						corporate positions. With the discovery of coaching in 2020, I began to fulfill my deep seated need for meaningful connection.				
						Today I am very grateful to be happily employed as a digital tranformation specialist while also supporting others to the 
						best of my coaching abilities. -->
