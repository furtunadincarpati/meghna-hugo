					     </br><p> Welcome! I am Vlad, a trained coach and human with a big <span aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-heart fa-anim-vertical-shake" style="color:#FF0064"></span>
					     
					     </br></br>For me, life is an exciting journey towards mastery, with change being a key part of it. Yet <u>change has not always been easy</u>.
					     It required my time, commitment, compassion, and letting go. And that's on a good day. In extreme cases I noticed that the need for change can arrive as a shock, 
					     in the form of life altering events such as separation, loss of employment, poor health, etc. Since I found change to be difficult even under regular circumstances,
		                             I developed my personality and life around the ability to create smooth transitions. Over time, I realized that this ability can be useful to others as well. 
					     That is where coaching comes in. Instead of life changes being a wake up call, coaching prepares and supports you during <b>smooth transitions</b>. 
					     </br>My coaching philosophy is aimed at transforming and navigating extremes by helping you access and integrate your deepest resources.   
					     <!-- </br>Speaking of smooth sailing, how is your connection to your hopes, dreams, and aspirations?
					     </br></br>My journey so far has helped refine an aptitude for communication, patterns, and people through various 
						corporate positions. With the discovery of coaching in 2020, I began to fulfill my deep seated need for meaningful connection.				
						Today I am very grateful to be happily employed as a digital tranformation specialist while also supporting others to the 
						best of my coaching abilities. -->
