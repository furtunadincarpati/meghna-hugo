					     <h3></br><p> Welcome! I am Vlad, a trained coach and human with a big <span aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-lg fa-heart fa-anim-vertical-shake" style="color:#FF0064"></span></b></h3>
					     </br>I am also one of those increasingly rare people who enjoy their 9 to 5. After working in various companies
					     and nearly experiencing a burnout, I saw the light.
					     </br></br><b><u>It was me!</u></b> 
		 			     </br></br>I was the one setting myself up for exhaustion, creating and maintaining a negative perception of my colleagues and of the work environment.
					     Slowly, very slowly, I began changing the way that I see work, my colleagues, and the entire work culture. And I am happy to tell you that it lead to a major shift and transformation.
					     I am no longer giving my power away believing that something outside of me is responsibile for my satisfaction and well-being. As a result, I am happy and motivated by my work,
					     creative and confident around all my colleagues, and most importantly, my effort is sustainable.   
				             </br></br>Your journey will likely be very different from mine, yet numerous people are struggling with achieving lasting satisfaction in a life dominated by work. 
					     Not to mention <b>all the things we run away from</b> every single moment: emotions, fears, thoughts about how society is broken, feeling overwhelmed by the speed of life, or by the amount of love in our hearts that we are unable to share.
					     If you resonate with this I invite you on a discovery journey sprinkled with breakthroughs and satisfaction, eventually rewarded by a definitive step forward in your life and an increase in your personal power and peace of mind. 
					     </br>In a nutshell...					</p>
					  
						<h4>I help you <u>face fears</u>, 
						<br>achieve a <b style="color:#21a008">sustainable flow</b>,
						<br>and become your own <b style="color:#FF9F1C">best friend</b>.</h4>
